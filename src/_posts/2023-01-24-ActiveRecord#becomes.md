With [`ActiveRecord#becomes`](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Persistence/becomes) any model can become a different class instantly.

I wished I've known this earlier.... especially b/c this has been available in [rails 2.0](https://apidock.com/rails/v2.0.3/ActiveRecord/Base/becomes) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (through the years I've been doing a lot of wizardy to mitigate STI problems...)
